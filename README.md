# Automatic_Cat_Feeder
Project to feed my cat that needs some help with weight management!

This Project uses an ESP32 with a servo motor to control the opening of the feeder.
It will also include a chime to make a sound when it is time to eat and it has remote access via WiFi.

The HTML, CSS and JS files are uploaded to the SPIFFS and uses websockets to keep data flow between the ESP32 and the active HTML session.
